      description: I love that TBT helps kids of all abilities and needs learn through play. The school has profoundly impacted my boys by fostering their curiosity and love of movement, while simultaneously teaching them all of the things without ever forcing them to sit at a desk. I'm so grateful for the unique and vital education TBT offers and I’m excited to have this opportunity to give back to the school community.

       Over the years, our family has been fortunate to share in all the programs  that TBT has had to offer our children.  They have had an opportunity to learn, grow, and thrive  in an environment that nurtures the whole child.  TBT allows our children to learn naturally, using the “superpowers” innate to all young children: curiosity, connection, empathy, and wonder.  
      extended_description: They find their way, appreciating how important they are to the world they make better.  Cultivated the way TBT has done, they will have abilities and perspectives that will enrich their experiences once they approach the more conventional, ordinary educational environments.  Being involved in the PTO is important to me because it helps foster a sense of community among TBT families, who  are from throughout the region, unlike a “neighborhood” elementary school.  To supplement the individual feedback to teachers, conversations among parents in this setting allows for sharing ideas and contributions to growth of the programs, including volunteering opportunities.  We have seen TBT grow considerably as a community, fostering a unique mission in helping our children learn and discover their connection to each other and nature.

      description: I love TBT because it allows my son (and eventually daughter) to learn in harmony with nature. The school nurtures curiosity, play, and discovery in a way that feels organic and soulful, and I’m grateful to be part of that journey. Through the PTO, I look forward to uplifting this community and offering my support wherever it’s needed.
